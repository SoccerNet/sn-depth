# Guidelines for the SoccerNet 2025 Challenge on Monocular Depth Estimation 

We are excited to announce the **Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE)** task as part of the SoccerNet challenges! This challenge focuses on estimating depth from **football** video sequences, encouraging participants to develop state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation in team sports.

## Challenge Overview

The **objective** of this task is to assign a depth value to each pixel in every frame of a football video sequence. The generated depth maps will be evaluated by comparing them to ground truth data sourced from video games. For this challenge, a new dataset will be constructed in a similar way to the existing dataset.

## Dataset Details

The Monocular Depth Estimation dataset includes **7,073 frames** from football videos, split into training, testing, and validation sets in a 60/20/20 distribution. Each game appears in only one set to ensure separation.

- **Football Frames**: 7,073 frames  
  - Training: 4,071 frames  
  - Testing: 1,423 frames  
  - Validation: 1,579 frames  

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the effectiveness of depth estimation methods, we use the following five metrics, averaged across the dataset predictions and ground truths:

1. **Absolute Relative Error (Abs Rel)**
2. **Squared Relative Error (Sq Rel)**
3. **Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)**
4. **Root-Mean-Square Error on Logarithm (RMSE log)**
5. **Scale Invariant Log Error (SILog)**

The evaluation code calculates these metrics to compare depth estimations from the proposed methods against the ground truth data.

## Participation Rules

- Open to anyone except the organizers.
- We recommend forming teams, but individual participation is also welcome.
- Each participant/team can only submit to one account per task.
- Only the video stream (visual and/or audio) may be used as input for this task.
- Participants can use custom models trained on publicly available datasets, with clear citation of any external datasets used.

## Submission and Winning Criteria

- The winner is the team with the highest performance on the **challenge** dataset, based on the above metrics.
- Submission deadlines and additional details will be announced soon.
- To be eligible for prizes, teams must submit a short report (CVPR format, max 2 pages) detailing their methodology.
